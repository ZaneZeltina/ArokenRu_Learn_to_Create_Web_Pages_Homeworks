        <h2>All about Links</h2>
        <p>
          We can use tag: <mark>a</mark> to create links in our page. Links can be two types.
        </p>
        <p>
          First type of links is navigation link: that can be navigate to another page, service. Outside from us page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second type: Links who are navigate into our page. To use this type of links, we must in tag a use obligatory attribute: <mark>href</mark>. In this attribute we must use value: <mark>"#block_1"</mark>. If we press on this link, we can navigate in our page to block_1. To make this possible, in first block we must to use attribute: <mark>id</mark> and in that value we write unique name. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <mark>Important!</mark> One ID name in one page, can be only one. It can't be repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, we must to use in tag: a attribute: <mark>target</mark> with value: "_blank". We must to do this for the user to stay in us page, but link will be opening in new window.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we need to add telephone number phone number as a link, in attribute: href, we must in value write: "tel:+37129909120". Don't forget in link write us phone number in link text. <mark>Important!</mark> In attribute: href and in link phone number must be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, we can add e-mail and skype option to us page use tag: a. If we want to add e-mail, in attribute: href, in value we need to write: <mark>"mailto:zanezeltina32@inbox.lv"
          </mark>. Don't forget it write in link. Text must be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we need to add skype nickname, we in attribute href value must to write: <mark>"skype:Zany1919"</mark>. Remember! In attribute href and in link text must be the same. But it is one thing: In link text: We don't write prefixes: tel, mailto, skype.
        </p>
        <p>
          In nowadays application Skype is rarely used. It is gradually being forgotten. Instead, they are used: Zoom, Google Meetings and another Meetings applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          look for all these with examples.
        </p>

        <div id="block_1">
          <h2>Here is: block_1</h2>
          <p>
            Here we create unique attribute: id name. With that we can navigate in our page. With that
            example we navigate to: <mark>block_1</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now look at the another ways to use links: use phone, e-mail and skype.
          </p>
          <a href="tel:+37129909120"> Call to Me: +37129909120</a>
          <p>
            Here we add link with call option.
          </p>
          <a href="mailto:zanezeltina32@inbox.lv">zanezeltina32@inbox.lv</a>
          <p>
            Here we add link with e-mail write option.
          </p>
          <a href="skype:Zany1919">My Skype: Zany1919</a>
          <p>

        <div id="block_2">
          <h2>Here we are creating: Buttons</h2>
          <h3>Here is block_2</h3>
          <p>
            Now we must to look, how we can create buttons in our page.
          </p>
          <p>
            We must to use tag: button with obligatory attribute: <mark>type</mark>. In attribute type value, we must to write some of these values: <mark>"submit, reset, button"</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use value: "submit", if we have a form and we want to send our data to server. Then we press button who have: <mark>type="submit"</mark>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use value: "reset", if we have a form in HTML page and we want to reset our entered data.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use value: "button", if it is just a button, where we can click.
          </p>
          <p>
            look for all these terms with examples.
          </p>
          <button type="submit">submit</button>
          <p>
            Submit button.
          </p>
          <button type="reset">reset</button>
          <p>
            Reset button.
          </p>
          <button type="button">Button</button>
          <p>
            Just clickable button.
          </p>

      <article>
        <div id="block_3">
          <h2>Buttons attributes</h2>
          <h3>Here is block_3</h3>
          <p>
            We know one of tag: button attribute. It is type. Tag: button has one more attribute. It is: autofocus. It is used, when we want to automatic make a focus on our button. In page, we can see 1px line around the button. it means, our buttons is in focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            <mark>Important!</mark> In one page we can use only one time tag: button attribute: autofocus! We can't use it twice in one page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where we need to use attribute: autofocus. it are use in situation, when we need to show to user some modal window, where if he want to click close button in in the upper corner of the window, the close button will be in focus. And all what he must to do is: press Enter on his keyboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we will learns <mark>CSS</mark> we will learn: CSS property: outline: 1px solid blue; In future, when we will learning CSS, we will change this, but now, we don't need to know it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look for this all with examples. Add three buttons, with different attribute: type values and add with attributes autofocus and one with attribute: disabled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also tag: button has an important attribute: disabled. That makes our button disabled. We see it, bu we can't use it. We cant to click on.
          </p>
          <h3>Create three buttons</h3>
          <p>
            Submit Button.
          </p>
          <button type="submit">Submit Button</button>
          <p>
            We create Reset Button with attribute: disabled.
          </p>
          <button type="reset" disabled>Reset Button</button>
          <p>
            We create ordinary button with obligatory attribute: type, and with autofocus attribute.
          </p>
          <button type="button" autofocus>Just Button</button>
